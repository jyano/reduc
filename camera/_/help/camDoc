// SMART //
// smart cam cap algorithms for stage dims:
// scale max: 4,  scale min: smaller dim- multiple
// x/y min: 0,   x/y max:  world x/y  * scale - game x/y 
//i thought i may want t for timer/ticker.. but time has no x and y !
//move the stage by manipulating the trackee x,y
//these funcs can change stage, or the tick can update it every tick based on its value w.tx/ w.ty?
//SLK: no buffer to worry about //it lets u gradually move past the target point.. until hits limit
